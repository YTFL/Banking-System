1. Initial transaction not saved: Initial deposit is recorded in INITIAL.dat but not in BANKING.dat, so reports show no transaction.
2. No cancel option mid-function: Once a function starts (like transaction or report), there's no way to go back without completing it.
3. Delete account has no confirmation: Account gets deleted immediately with no confirmation prompt.
4. Large amount causes overflow: Very large deposit values exceed data type limits and result in incorrect balances and corrupted .dat file.
5. Monthly report balance: doesn’t show the proper balance.
6. Wrong account used for transaction: If a valid but wrong account number is entered, the transaction goes through without any confirmation.
7. Wrong amount entered: There's no way to correct a mistyped amount. The only option is to make another reverse transaction, which creates confusion.
8. No cancel option during transaction: If the user changes their mind mid-transaction, there's no way to cancel.
10. No confirmation when creating new account: There is no option to cancel at the start or confirm at the end, so accounts can be created accidentally without review.
11. No review before saving account or modified details: When creating or modifying an account, there’s no summary or confirmation before saving, which can lead to unintentional changes.
12. No check for exact duplicate name and address: If the user enters a name and address that exactly match an existing account, the system doesn’t notify them or allow them to retrieve the old account, potentially leading to unnecessary duplicate accounts.
