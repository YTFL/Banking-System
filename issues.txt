1. Account gets deleted even if balance is not zero: The system allows account deletion without checking if the user has withdrawn all money, which could result in loss of funds.
2. getchar() used for Y/N input accepts full words like yes or no because only the first character is checked, making inputs like yes wrongly accepted. Fixed by switching to fgets() + strict length check.
