## IMPORTANT NOTICE
None of the implemented functions have been tested for working, it can all be tested only once other functions are implemented. The functions that are currently implemented can only be work only theortetically so don't bother testing the functions yet.

for accoount number:
Uniqueness: Each account number must be unique within the bank.
Format: The PDF suggests using a 10-digit numeric account number.
Generation Logic:
When a new account is created, the system should generate the next available account number by incrementing the highest existing account number by 1.
For example, if the highest account number is 1000000005, the next account will be 1000000006.
Starting Number: The PDF recommends starting from a base number, such as 1000000001.

for account deletion:
Input: Account number to be deleted
Process: Copy all records except the one to delete into a temp file â†’ overwrite original file
Result: The account no longer exists in the system

clear function notice:
it clears the entire console screen and idk how to implement only clearing of few  specified lines
this function must be added to all the menus so that the user can choose to clear the screen anytime required and once the screen is cleared, main menu is printed again, pretty much starting over, before the main menu is called, everything is returned first clearing the stack only keeping the function call for main menu preventing stack overflow
